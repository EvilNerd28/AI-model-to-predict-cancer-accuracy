# AI-model-to-predict-cancer-accuracy
The aim of this project is to create a robust and accurate tool that can assist in detecting the likelihood of cancer based on input data, and subsequently evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model.
<br>
The "Cancer Detection and Prediction using AI" project aims to develop an accurate and reliable AI-powered system using Python that can effectively analyze medical data to detect the presence of cancer and provide predictions about its severity. This project will leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and analyze medical images and patient data, ultimately contributing to early and accurate diagnosis, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes.
